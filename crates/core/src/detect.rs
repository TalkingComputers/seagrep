//! Content-class detection for automatic index-strategy selection.

//! Trigram dictionaries are compact and selective on structured content
//! (code, logs, JSON) but collapse on natural-language prose, where every
//! common word's trigrams appear in nearly every document. Sparse
//! dictionaries invert the trade. The classifier below separates the two on
//! decoded text; thresholds were calibrated on real corpora (Gutenberg
//! books, the Linux kernel tree, GH Archive JSON): prose scored 100% of
//! bytes prose-like, the kernel tree 24% (its Documentation prose), JSON 0%.

/// Whether decoded content reads as natural-language prose. `None` when the
/// sample is too short to judge.
///
/// Only ASCII letters count as alphabetic, so non-Latin prose (CJK, heavy
/// diacritics) classifies as structured and gets the trigram strategy — the
/// conservative direction, since multi-byte scripts produce high-entropy
/// trigrams that prune well.
